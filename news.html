<h1>The future of Sol Client's launcher</h1>
<p>This launcher (but not the actual client) has been discontinued and will not work for the next release! If you would like a new one to be developed react to the poll on our Discord server, however people do not seem to want this currently. Note that you can already use the installer to install to other launchers.</p>
